Implementing dm-verity for a rootfs data partition in Clear Linux

- Use mixer to create a CLR linux image with the following:
  - Enable support for dm-verity in the CLR linux image.
    - Set “CONFIG_DM_VERITY=y” in the kernel config file and build the linux kernel package.
  - Use the sample "release-image-config.json" file provided in this folder.
    Ensure that all the bundles listed in this file are included in the mix.

- Run the "dm-verity-impl-1.py" program with input as the path to the .img file.
  E.g. "sudo python3 dm-verity-impl-1.py release.img"

- Boot it on QEMU using the qemu startup script with the .img file as input.

Not Tested:
- Flash the .img file to a USB stick
  E.g "sudo dd if=release.img of=/dev/sdd bs=4M status=progress"

- Boot the target system from the USB stick.
